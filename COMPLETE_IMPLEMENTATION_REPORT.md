## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Only Job Results ❌ → FIXED ✓

**Problem**: Searches returned only job-related results; products, QA, events were ignored

**Solution**:

- Created `IntentExtractor` class with specialized handlers for each intent type
- Updated `fallback_synthesize()` to use appropriate extractor based on detected intent
- Now properly handles: jobs, products, events, services, general Q&A

**Files Modified**: `answer_agent.py`, NEW: `intent_extractors.py`

---

### Issue #2: Same Results for All Searches ❌ → FIXED ✓

**Problem**: Every job search returned hardcoded "Senior Python Developer" and "Python Backend Engineer"

**Solution**:

- Replaced hardcoded mock data with content extraction
- `extract_jobs()` uses regex to find: job titles, companies, locations, salaries
- Results are unique per query, based on actual crawled content

**Files Modified**: `answer_agent.py`, `intent_extractors.py`

---

### Issue #3: Limited Search Strategy ❌ → FIXED ✓

**Problem**: Same search queries, same results, no diversity

**Solution**:

- Created `_generate_search_queries()` to produce 3-5 intent-specific queries
- Jobs: adds LinkedIn site search, "remote", "salary" variants
- Products: adds "review", "best", "comparison", "price"
- Events: adds year, eventbrite/meetup site searches
- Services: adds "near me", location modifiers

**Files Modified**: `intent_classifier.py`

---

### Issue #4: Weak Intent Classification ❌ → FIXED ✓

**Problem**: Simple keyword matching couldn't distinguish between intents reliably

**Solution**:

- Implemented strong vs weak keyword indicators
- Dynamic confidence scoring (0.6 to 0.99 instead of fixed 0.75)
- Better differentiation between similar keywords in different contexts

**Files Modified**: `intent_classifier.py`

---

### Issue #5: Limited Crawling Coverage ❌ → FIXED ✓

**Problem**: Only crawled 4 URLs with 2 search queries

**Solution**:

- Increased from 2 to 4 search queries (100% increase)
- Increased from 4 to 8 URLs crawled (100% increase)
- Better deduplication and more comprehensive search

**Files Modified**: `search_agent_service.py`

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Intent Classifier Improvements

**Before**:

```python
def fallback_classify(query: str) -> IntentResult:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    intent = UserIntent.GENERAL_QNA

    job_keywords = ["job", "career", "hiring", ...]
    if any(k in query_lower for k in job_keywords):
        intent = UserIntent.JOB_SEARCH

    return IntentResult(
        intent=intent,
        confidence=0.75,  # Fixed!
        keywords=keywords[:5],
        suggested_queries=[query]  # Only original query!
    )
```

**After**:

```python
def fallback_classify(query: str) -> IntentResult:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    intent = UserIntent.GENERAL_QNA

    # Strong indicators (high confidence)
    job_strong = ["job", "career", "hiring", ...]  # Exact matches
    # Weak indicators (supplementary)
    job_weak = ["developer", "engineer", "remote", ...]  # Contextual

    # Match counting
    job_strong_matches = sum(1 for k in job_strong if k in query_lower)
    job_weak_matches = sum(1 for k in job_weak if k in query_lower)

    # Confidence calculation (dynamic)
    if job_strong_matches >= 1:
        confidence = 0.85 + (job_strong_matches * 0.05)
    elif job_strong_matches + job_weak_matches >= 2:
        confidence = 0.72

    # Generate diverse queries
    suggested_queries = _generate_search_queries(query, intent)

    return IntentResult(
        intent=intent,
        confidence=min(0.99, confidence),  # Dynamic!
        keywords=keywords[:5],
        suggested_queries=suggested_queries  # 3-5 diverse queries!
    )
```

### 2. Answer Synthesizer Improvements

**Before**:

```python
def fallback_synthesize(query: str, intent: str, ranked_pages: List[dict]) -> AnswerResponse:
    jobs = []
    if intent == "jobs":
        # HARDCODED MOCK JOBS - ALWAYS THE SAME!
        jobs = [
            JobListing(
                title="Senior Python Developer",
                company="Acme Corporation",
                location="Remote",
                salary_range="$140,000 - $170,000",
                apply_url="https://linkedin.com",
                match_score=95
            ),
            JobListing(
                title="Python Backend Engineer",
                company="TechCorp Systems",
                location="New York, NY",
                salary_range="$130,000 - $160,000",
                apply_url="https://indeed.com",
                match_score=88
            )
        ]
    else:
        action_prompt = "Would you like to search for more detailed reviews or compare options?"

    return AnswerResponse(main_answer=..., jobs=jobs, action_prompt=...)
```

**After**:

```python
def fallback_synthesize(query: str, intent: str, ranked_pages: List[dict]) -> AnswerResponse:
    combined_content = " ".join([r.get('content', '') for r in ranked_pages])

    # DYNAMIC EXTRACTION BASED ON INTENT
    if intent.lower() == "jobs":
        jobs = IntentExtractor.extract_jobs(combined_content, query, ranked_pages)
        action_prompt = f"Would you like to apply to any of these positions?"
    elif intent.lower() == "products":
        products = IntentExtractor.extract_products(combined_content, query, ranked_pages)
        action_prompt = "Would you like to compare these products?"
    elif intent.lower() == "events":
        events = IntentExtractor.extract_events(combined_content, query, ranked_pages)
        action_prompt = "Would you like to register for any of these events?"
    elif intent.lower() == "services":
        services = IntentExtractor.extract_services(combined_content, query, ranked_pages)
        action_prompt = "Would you like to contact any of these service providers?"
    else:
        action_prompt = f"Would you like to search for more information about {query}?"

    return AnswerResponse(main_answer=..., jobs=jobs, action_prompt=...)
```

### 3. Search Strategy Improvements

**Before**:

```python
search_queries = intent_result.suggested_queries[:2]  # Only 2!
target_results = unique_search_results[:4]  # Only 4!
```

**After**:

```python
search_queries = intent_result.suggested_queries[:4]  # Up to 4!
target_results = unique_search_results[:8]  # Up to 8!
```
