## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can we do this incrementally?**  
A: Yes! MVP (basic Q&A + job search) is 42 hours (1 week). Full implementation is 106 hours (3-4 weeks).

**Q: Do we need to rewrite TruthShield?**  
A: No! Keep fact-checking. Add new modules alongside it. Eventually retire fact-checking if not needed.

**Q: What's the hardest part?**  
A: Web crawler and ranking algorithm. But both are well-understood problems with many libraries available.

**Q: Can we reuse existing code?**  
A: Yes! Fact-checker's multi-agent pattern can be adapted for answer generation.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**  
A: Performance (keeping responses <5 seconds). Solution: caching, async operations, optimization.

**Q: Do we need ML/AI expertise?**  
A: Helpful but not required. We use Pydantic-AI which handles LLM interaction. Main work is plumbing.

**Q: Can one person do this?**  
A: Yes, in 3-4 weeks. Best with 2 people: 1 backend, 1 frontend (parallelizes work).
